# MILLO_Tech_Interview

Hello Professor Pagniello and application review committee,

I'd like to thank you for this opportunity to apply for the MILLO Group and to complete this technical interview. 
In this repository, you will find code pertaining to the Part 1 and Part 3 data sent to me by Professor Pagniello.
The code in the first part breaks down the different variables by hourly averages and the third part creates a waveform diagram and a spectrogram to analyze the sounds.

In order to run the code, please have the following librarys installed: pandas, scipy, and numpy.

Hope to hear from you soon.
Greg Roitbourd
